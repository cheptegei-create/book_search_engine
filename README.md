# Book Search Engine

## Description

To build a fully functioning MERN application that allows users search and save books. This project application is for book lovers, and it helps by easily searching for a specific book and saving it for later. It makes it easy to search for a book, keep track of the books one has already read, and creating a list for future reads. I was able to create a fully functioning MERN stack application
